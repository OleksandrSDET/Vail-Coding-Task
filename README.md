# Vail-Coding-Task

This is my coding submission for the pre-interview assignment for the Software Engineer, Test & Infrastructure II role at Vail Systems.

## 🧠 Problem Summary

The task is to write a program that rotates an array of integers to the **left** by a given number of positions.

### Example:

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, rotate by `2`
- Output: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]`

The solution should also:
- Work if the number of rotations is greater than the array length (e.g. `rotate by 8`)
- Gracefully handle **negative input values** by printing an error message or rejecting the input

## 🛠️ Language Used

- Java  
- The code is written in plain Java, without using any frameworks or external libraries

## 📁 File Description

- `VailTask.java` – Main Java file that contains the solution and can be run from the command line or IDE.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse)
3. Run the `main` method in `VailTask.java`
